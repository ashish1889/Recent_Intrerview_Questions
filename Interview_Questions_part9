There are indeed many situations where applying
operator delete on a pointer to destroy the pointed-to object is not an option:
Sometimes, T::~T() is private or protected , making it inaccessible to other classes such as unique_ptr<T> .
Sometimes, the nalization semantics require doing something else than calling delete ‚Äì for example, calling a 
destroy()
or release() member function
Sometimes, the expectation is to call a free function that will perform auxiliary work in addition to freeing a 
resource.

template<class T, class D = std::default_delete<T>>
class unique_ptr {
    // ...
};

unique_ptr is a smart pointer that owns a dynamically allocated object.

It takes two template parameters:

T ‚Üí the type of the object it manages

D ‚Üí the "deleter" (what to do when the unique_ptr is destroyed).

If you don‚Äôt specify a deleter, it uses std::default_delete<T>.

So D is customizable, but by default it‚Äôs just "delete the pointer".

2. What is default_delete<T>?

template<class T>
struct default_delete {
    constexpr default_delete() noexcept = default;

    constexpr void operator()(T* p) const {
        delete p;
    }
};

This is a function object (functor):

It has operator(), so it can be "called like a function".

If you pass it a T*, it will do delete p.

Marked constexpr and noexcept because deletion is simple, and this allows more optimizations.

Think of it like a small struct whose only job is to delete a pointer:

default_delete<int> d;
int* p = new int(42);
d(p);   // calls delete p;


3. How unique_ptr uses it

When a unique_ptr<T> goes out of scope:

It checks if it owns a pointer ptr.

If yes, it calls the deleter: D{}(ptr).

By default, that‚Äôs default_delete<T>()(ptr) ‚Üí which is just delete ptr;.

Example:

std::unique_ptr<int> up(new int(5));
// when up goes out of scope -> calls default_delete<int>()(ptr)

4. Why not just delete inside unique_ptr?

Because we want flexibility.
With a custom deleter, you could:

Use free() instead of delete.

Call fclose() for a FILE*.

Log something before deleting.

Example:

struct FreeDeleter {
    void operator()(int* p) const { std::free(p); }
};

std::unique_ptr<int, FreeDeleter> ptr((int*)std::malloc(sizeof(int)));

‚úÖ Summary:

default_delete<T> is a little callable struct that just says: ‚Äúwhen called with a T*, run delete p.‚Äù

unique_ptr uses it by default to clean up its resource.

But you can plug in your own deleter if needed.

==========================================================================================================================================
let‚Äôs do a ‚Äúplay-by-play‚Äù of what happens when a std::unique_ptr<int> goes out of scope.

#include <memory>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<int> up(new int(42));
    // work with up...
} // <- scope ends here

Step 1: Construction

new int(42) allocates an int on the heap and returns a raw pointer (say 0x1234).

std::unique_ptr<int> stores this pointer inside itself.

Since we didn‚Äôt provide a deleter, it uses the default one:

using deleter_type = std::default_delete<int>;

Step 2: Scope ends

When execution leaves the main() function:

The destructor ~unique_ptr() is called.

The destructor looks roughly like:

~unique_ptr() {
    if (ptr != nullptr) {
        deleter(ptr);
    }
}
(where deleter is a default_delete<int>).

Step 3: Call the deleter

deleter(ptr) is shorthand for:
default_delete<int>::operator()(ptr);

That means it goes into default_delete and calls:

void operator()(int* p) const {
    delete p;
}

Step 4: Delete the memory

delete ptr; calls the destructor of the object (int in this case, trivial)

Then frees the heap memory at 0x1234.

At this point, the resource is cleaned up automatically.

Step 5: Done

No memory leaks, no dangling resources. üéØ

===========================================================================================================================================

#include <memory>
class requires_dynamic_alloc {
~requires_dynamic_alloc() = default; // private
// ...
friend struct cleaner;
};
// ...
struct cleaner {
template <class T>
void operator()(T *p) const { delete p; }
};
int main() {
using namespace std;
// requires_dynamic_alloc r0; // no
//auto p0 = unique_ptr<requires_dynamic_alloc>{
//
new requires_dynamic_alloc
//}; // no, as delete not available to default deleter
auto p1 = unique_ptr<requires_dynamic_alloc, cleaner>{
new requires_dynamic_alloc
}; // ok, will use cleaner::operator() to delete pointee
}

Step 1. The class with restricted destructor

class requires_dynamic_alloc {
    ~requires_dynamic_alloc() = default; // private
    friend struct cleaner;
};

~requires_dynamic_alloc() is declared private.
‚Üí This means ordinary code (like in main) cannot call delete or let it go out of scope as an automatic variable.

So requires_dynamic_alloc r0; is illegal ‚Äî the destructor is inaccessible.

But friend struct cleaner; is declared.
‚Üí cleaner has permission to access the private destructor.

Step 2. The custom deleter
struct cleaner {
    template <class T>
    void operator()(T* p) const { delete p; }
};

This is a function object that unique_ptr can use to clean up its resource.

Since cleaner is a friend of requires_dynamic_alloc, it can call the private destructor through delete.

Step 3. Why default_delete doesn‚Äôt work

Normally, unique_ptr<T> uses std::default_delete<T> as the deleter:

template <class T>
struct default_delete {
    void operator()(T* p) const { delete p; }
};

But default_delete is not a friend of requires_dynamic_alloc.
So if you try:
auto p0 = std::unique_ptr<requires_dynamic_alloc>{ new requires_dynamic_alloc };

then default_delete<requires_dynamic_alloc> tries to call delete, but it‚Äôs not allowed to access the 
private destructor ‚Üí compile error.

Step 4. The working case

auto p1 = std::unique_ptr<requires_dynamic_alloc, cleaner>{
    new requires_dynamic_alloc
};

Here:

cleaner is a friend, so it can legally call the private destructor.

So when p1 goes out of scope, cleaner::operator() runs and does delete p.

This allows controlled dynamic allocation and deletion.

‚úÖ Big picture:

This pattern enforces that objects of requires_dynamic_alloc can only be heap-allocated and only managed by 
a smart pointer (with an approved deleter).

It prevents accidental stack allocation or raw deletes.
============================================================================================================

#include <memory>
struct releasable {
void release() {
// overly simplified for the sake of this example
delete this;
}
protected:
~releasable() = default;
};
class important_resource : public releasable {
// ...
};
void release(releasable *p) {
if(p) p->release();
}
int main() {
using namespace std;
auto p = unique_ptr<important_resource,
void(*)(releasable*)>{
new important_resource, release
}; // ok, will use release() to delete pointee
}


Nice ‚Äî you‚Äôve brought in another smart-pointer/deleter pattern, 
this time using a release() member. Let‚Äôs break it down step by step.

1. The base class with a protected destructor

struct releasable {
    void release() {
        // overly simplified
        delete this;
    }
protected:
    ~releasable() = default;
};

~releasable() is protected, not public.

That means normal code cannot delete p; if p is a pointer to releasable or its subclasses.

This protects against accidental deletion by non-friends / non-members.

Instead, releasable provides a public member function release() that does delete this;.

So the object can destroy itself safely, but only if the caller uses the correct interface.

2. The derived class

class important_resource : public releasable {
    // ...
};

important_resource inherits the protected destructor from releasable.

Same rule applies: you can‚Äôt just delete an important_resource* in outside code.

3. Free function release

void release(releasable* p) {
    if (p) p->release();
}

This is just a helper function that forwards to p->release().

It becomes handy as a function pointer deleter.


4. The smart pointer

auto p = unique_ptr<important_resource,
    void(*)(releasable*)>{
        new important_resource, release
};

unique_ptr has two template parameters:
unique_ptr<T, Deleter>.
Here:

T = important_resource

Deleter = void(*)(releasable*) (a function pointer type)

When p goes out of scope:

The release function is called on the stored pointer.

release() then calls the release() member on the object.

That deletes the object through delete this;


‚úÖ Big picture

This is another way to control object lifetime:

Objects can‚Äôt be destroyed directly (destructor protected).

They must be destroyed via the controlled release() path.

By giving unique_ptr a custom deleter (the free release function), you integrate this pattern with RAII.


What‚Äôs the difference between the first pattern you showed me (using a friend deleter) and this 
one (using a release() member)?
Why might a library author prefer this release() style instead of the friend approach?

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs put the two side by side, and tease apart the difference.

üîπ Pattern 1 (your first code with friend cleaner)

class requires_dynamic_alloc {
    ~requires_dynamic_alloc() = default; // private
    friend struct cleaner;
};

struct cleaner {
    template<class T>
    void operator()(T* p) const { delete p; }
};


Destructor is private.

Only the cleaner functor can call delete p;.

So the lifetime is controlled through unique_ptr<T, cleaner>.

Key idea: Only ‚Äútrusted‚Äù deleters (friends) are allowed to destroy the object.

üîπ Pattern 2 (your second code with releasable)

struct releasable {
    void release() { delete this; }
protected:
    ~releasable() = default;
};


Destructor is protected.

You can‚Äôt delete p; directly from outside.

Instead, the object teaches itself how to be destroyed: you must call p->release().

A custom deleter for unique_ptr just forwards to that release function.

Key idea: Destruction happens through the object‚Äôs own interface, not through a friend.

üîπ So, what‚Äôs the real difference?

Friend deleter style

External function/object (cleaner) is trusted to delete.

More encapsulated: the object itself doesn‚Äôt expose a delete this call.

Slightly safer ‚Äî no chance of misuse like double-calling release().

But you need to wire up the friend relationship.

Release() style

The object itself defines how it can be destroyed.

Any code that has a pointer to releasable can call release().

Simpler to set up (no friend declarations).

But a little riskier: if someone calls p->release() manually while a unique_ptr still exists, 
you could get a double-delete.

‚úÖ Big-picture summary

Both patterns stop accidental raw deletes and force you to use a controlled destruction path.

Friend deleter = outsider does cleanup, but only if trusted.

Release method = object deletes itself when asked.
