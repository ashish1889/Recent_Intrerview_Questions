Exlaination- Beginner/Intermediate level-

#include <memory>

Includes the standard header that defines std::unique_ptr (and other smart pointers).

struct releasable {
    void release() {
        // overly simplified for the sake of this example
        delete this;
    }
protected:
    ~releasable() = default;
};


Declares a base type releasable.

release() is a member that does delete this; — it destroys the object from inside the object.
Important: delete this is valid only if the object was allocated with new and you don’t use it after deletion.

The destructor ~releasable() is protected. That prevents outside code from doing delete p 
when p is a releasable* (forces controlled deletion via release() or friends).

class important_resource : public releasable {
    // ...
};

A derived class; it inherits release() and the protected destructor from releasable. 
Instances are intended to be deleted via the class-provided mechanism, not by arbitrary delete from outside.

void release(releasable *p) {
    if (p) p->release();
}


A free helper function that calls the member release();
this matches the signature void(*)(releasable*) (function pointer) and can be used as a custom deleter for unique_ptr.

int main() {
    using namespace std;

Enter main and bring std names into scope (just for brevity in this example).

auto p = unique_ptr<important_resource, void(*)(releasable*)>{
    new important_resource, release
}; // ok, will use release() to delete pointee


Creates a std::unique_ptr named p whose managed type is important_resource.

The deleter type D is void(*)(releasable*) — a function pointer type. 
The braced initializer provides the raw pointer (new important_resource) and the deleter function (release).

When p is destroyed, unique_ptr will call the stored function pointer release(p.get()), which in turn calls p->release() → delete this.

Because the deleter type here is a function pointer (non-empty type), the unique_ptr object typically stores both the managed pointer 
and a function pointer. That commonly makes sizeof(p) larger than a plain pointer.

static_assert(sizeof(p) > sizeof(void*));

A compile-time check that expects the unique_ptr p to be larger than a raw pointer (because it stores the extra function-pointer deleter). 
If the implementation didn’t add storage for the deleter, this would fail.

auto q = unique_ptr<
    important_resource,
    decltype([](auto p) { release(p); })
>{
    new important_resource
};

This constructs another unique_ptr named q.

The deleter type is decltype([](auto p){ release(p); }) — the closure (unnamed) type of a generic lambda [](auto p){ release(p); }.

The lambda captures nothing (no [=] or [&]), so its closure object is an empty type (no stored data). 
unique_ptr default-constructs that deleter (we didn’t pass it explicitly).

An empty deleter type allows compilers/implementations to optimize storage (Empty Base Optimization or similar) so 
the unique_ptr may be the same size as a raw pointer.

static_assert(sizeof(q) == sizeof(void*));

A compile-time check that expects the unique_ptr q to occupy the same size as a raw pointer — i.e., 
the deleter added no extra storage (thanks to the empty closure type + compiler optimization).

Key takeaways / short summary

unique_ptr<T,D> stores both the pointer and an instance of the deleter type D. The deleter’s type determines extra storage.

A function-pointer deleter is non-empty (stores a pointer) → unique_ptr size grows.

A stateless lambda (empty closure) can be optimized away (EBO) → unique_ptr can stay pointer-sized.

protected destructor + release() pattern enforces controlled deletion; delete this is done safely (if allocated by new) from inside the class.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<advanced-level C++ explanation>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
We’ll go deep into object lifetime rules, type erasure, EBO, and ABI aspects.

1. The releasable base

struct releasable {
    void release() {
        delete this;
    }
protected:
    ~releasable() = default;
};

Protected destructor:
This is a common RAII pattern: you cannot delete a releasable* directly from user code, but you can delete through release().
→ This enforces controlled lifetime management.

delete this;:
Valid only if *this was created by new (heap allocated) and is not already destroyed.
It destroys the object and deallocates memory in one step.
Because the destructor is protected, external code cannot bypass the release() funnel.

So: releasable is self-deleting — you hand control of destruction to the object itself.

2. important_resource inheritance

class important_resource : public releasable {
    // ...
};

This means any important_resource can be destroyed via release(), but not via raw delete. This forces consistent cleanup.

3. Free release() function

void release(releasable *p) {
    if (p) p->release();
}

This is a free function deleter with the exact signature:

void(*)(releasable*)

That’s key because unique_ptr expects a callable deleter type. Here, it’s just a raw function pointer.

4. First unique_ptr: with function pointer deleter

auto p = unique_ptr<important_resource,
                    void(*)(releasable*)>{
    new important_resource, release
};

Here’s what happens:

unique_ptr<T,D> stores:

T* (the raw managed pointer)

D (the deleter instance)

With D = void(*)(releasable*), the deleter is a function pointer type. Function pointers are not empty;
they require storage (typically 1 word, sizeof(void*)).

So the layout of p is conceptually like:

struct unique_ptr_like {
    important_resource* ptr;
    void (*deleter)(releasable*);
};
That’s why:
static_assert(sizeof(p) > sizeof(void*));
is expected to pass — it must be bigger than a raw pointer.

5. Second unique_ptr: with generic lambda deleter

auto q = unique_ptr<
    important_resource,
    decltype([](auto p){ release(p); })
>{
    new important_resource
};

Here’s the trick:

decltype([](auto p){ release(p); }) is the closure type of the lambda.

This lambda has:

No captures ([] empty).

Only a generic call operator template (operator()(auto p)).

So the closure object is an empty class type.

According to the C++ object model:

An empty class has sizeof at least 1,

but unique_ptr implementations almost always store the deleter via empty base optimization (EBO):

If D is an empty type, unique_ptr<T,D> can inherit privately from it.

This makes sizeof(unique_ptr<T,D>) == sizeof(T*).

That’s why:
static_assert(sizeof(q) == sizeof(void*));
is expected to pass.

6. ABI & performance implications

Function pointer deleter (p):

Runtime cost: one extra word in the object, indirect call through the function pointer.

Slightly larger object size → might hurt cache locality if you have many such smart pointers.

Stateless lambda deleter (q):

Zero-cost abstraction: the deleter carries no state, so it disappears via EBO.

The deleter call is usually inlined (release(p)) since the compiler knows the closure type at compile time.

Same size as raw pointer, but with full RAII semantics.

This demonstrates why stateless lambdas are superior deleters compared to raw function pointers.

7. Subtleties of delete this

Only safe if object was created with new.

Calling release() on a stack-allocated object would be UB (since delete this would attempt to free stack memory).

The protected destructor reduces the chance of misuse: you can’t do delete stackObj because destructor isn’t public.

8. Key lessons

unique_ptr stores both pointer and deleter; the deleter type dictates object size.

Function pointer deleters cost extra storage.

Empty lambdas are EBO-friendly → size = raw pointer.

Self-deleting classes are unusual but sometimes used for controlled lifetime management.

C++ lets you write “zero-cost abstractions”: q shows no runtime penalty for custom deleter.
