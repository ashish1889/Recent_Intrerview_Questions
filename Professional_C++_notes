The following function properly allocates memory for a two-­dimensional array:

char** allocateCharacterBoard(size_t xDimension, size_t yDimension)
{
char** myArray { new char*[xDimension] }; // Allocate first dimension
for (size_t i { 0 }; i < xDimension; ++i) {
myArray[i] = new char[yDimension];
// Allocate ith subarray
}
return myArray;
}


Similarly, when you want to release the memory associated with a multidimensional free store-­based
array, the array delete[] syntax will not clean up the subarrays on your behalf. Your code to release
an array should mirror the code to allocate it, as in the following function:
void releaseCharacterBoard(char**& myArray, size_t xDimension)
{
for (size_t i { 0 }; i < xDimension; ++i) {
delete [] myArray[i];
// Delete ith subarray
myArray[i] = nullptr;
}
delete [] myArray;
// Delete first dimension
myArray = nullptr;
}

In new code, you should use the C++ Standard Library containers such as std::array and vector. For example, use vector<T> for a one-­dimensional dynamic array. For a two-­dimensional dynamic array, you could use
vector<vector<T>>, and similar for higher dimensions.
