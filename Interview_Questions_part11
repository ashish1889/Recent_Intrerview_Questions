This code defines a type trait to check if a given type is a function pointer suitable for use as a deleter (likely in the context of smart pointers).

manipulation of types. These tools help in writing more generic and robust C++ code.

namespace managing_memory_book {
// ...
}

namespace managing_memory_book { ... }: This creates a namespace called managing_memory_book. 
Namespaces are used to organize code and prevent name collisions, especially in large projects. It logically groups the following code related to memory management (as the name suggests).

template <class T>
struct is_deleter_function_candidate
: std::false_type {};

template <class T> struct is_deleter_function_candidate : std::false_type {};: This defines a class template named is_deleter_function_candidate. 
This is the core of our type trait.
template <class T>: This indicates that the struct is a template and accepts a type parameter T. T will be the type we want to check.
struct is_deleter_function_candidate: Defines the struct itself.
: std::false_type {}: This is inheritance from std::false_type. This is crucial. It sets the default value of the type trait to false. That is, 
by default, the type T is not considered a suitable deleter function candidate. The inheritance from std::false_type provides a convenient way 
to represent a boolean false at compile time as a type. The empty braces {} are used for default initialization.

template <class T>
struct is_deleter_function_candidate<void (*)(T*)>
: std::true_type {};

template <class T> struct is_deleter_function_candidate<void (*)(T*)> : std::true_type {};: This is a partial specialization of the is_deleter_function_candidate template. 
Partial specialization allows you to provide a different implementation of a template for specific types.
template <class T>: Again, declares that it is a template.
struct is_deleter_function_candidate<void (*)(T*)>: This is the specialization. It says: "If the type T is exactly a pointer to a function that 
takes a pointer to T as an argument and returns void, then..."
void (*)(T*): This is the specific type that triggers this specialization. It represents a function pointer where:
void: The function returns nothing.
(*): Indicates it's a function pointer.
(T*): The function takes a single argument, which is a pointer to a type T.
: std::true_type {}: This inherits from std::true_type. This means that if T matches the pattern void (*)(T*), 
the type trait will evaluate to true. Similar to std::false_type, std::true_type represents a boolean true at compile time as a type.


template <class T>
constexpr auto is_deleter_function_candidate_v =
is_deleter_function_candidate<T>::value;

template <class T> constexpr auto is_deleter_function_candidate_v = is_deleter_function_candidate<T>::value;: This line provides a convenient way to access the value of the type trait as a constexpr variable.
template <class T>: Again, declares it's a template.
constexpr auto is_deleter_function_candidate_v: Declares a constexpr variable named is_deleter_function_candidate_v. constexpr means that the value of this variable can be computed at compile time. 
auto lets the compiler deduce the type (which will be bool). The v suffix is a common convention to indicate a variable holding the value of a type trait.
= is_deleter_function_candidate<T>::value;: This assigns the value of the type trait to the variable. is_deleter_function_candidate<T>::value accesses the value member of the
is_deleter_function_candidate struct (which is inherited from std::true_type or std::false_type). This effectively gives us a boolean value (true or false) representing whether T is a suitable deleter function candidate.

In summary:

This code defines a type trait that checks if a given type is a function pointer that takes a pointer to its own type as an argument (and returns void). This type of function pointer is often used as a deleter in smart pointers 
to release dynamically allocated memory. The is_deleter_function_candidate_v variable provides a convenient way to access the result of this check at compile time.

It appears to be a simplified implementation of a unique_ptr class, aiming to mimic the functionality of the standard library's std::unique_ptr.
I'll explain each part, from the namespace declaration to the destructor.

namespace managing_memory_book {

namespace managing_memory_book {: This line declares a namespace called managing_memory_book. Namespaces are used to organize code and avoid naming conflicts,
especially in larger projects. All the code within the curly braces {} is part of this namespace. It's a way to encapsulate related functionalities.

template <class T, class D = default_deleter<T>>
class unique_ptr : std::conditional_t <
is_deleter_function_candidate_v<D>,
deleter_pointer_wrapper<T>, D
> {


template <class T, class D = default_deleter<T>>: This line introduces a class template.
class T: This declares a template parameter T, which represents the type of object that the unique_ptr will manage (point to). For example, unique_ptr<int> would manage integer objects.
class D = default_deleter<T>: This declares a second template parameter D, representing the deleter. The deleter is responsible for freeing the memory associated with the managed object 
when the unique_ptr goes out of scope. default_deleter<T> is specified as the default value for D. This likely means if you don't provide a custom deleter, a default one (typically delete) will be used.
class unique_ptr : std::conditional_t <is_deleter_function_candidate_v<D>, deleter_pointer_wrapper<T>, D>: This line defines the unique_ptr class and its inheritance. It uses std::conditional_t to 
conditionally determine the base class based on the type of deleter (D).
std::conditional_t<condition, type_if_true, type_if_false>: This is a template metaprogramming construct. It evaluates the condition at compile time. If the condition is true, 
the type becomes type_if_true; otherwise, it becomes type_if_false.
is_deleter_function_candidate_v<D>: This is a type trait (likely a custom one) that checks if the type D is a function pointer (or something that can be called like a function). 
In other words, is it a function that can delete an object of type T? The _v suffix indicates this is a variable template â€“ it evaluates to a bool value at compile time.
deleter_pointer_wrapper<T>: This is likely a wrapper class that handles function pointer deleters. It's used when a function pointer is provided as the deleter. 
It will store and invoke the function pointer when needed.
D: If D is not a function pointer (e.g., it's a custom functor class), then unique_ptr directly inherits from D. This allows the deleter to have custom behaviour.
In essence, this inheritance structure allows unique_ptr to handle both function pointer deleters (via the wrapper) and custom deleter objects directly.

using deleter_type = std::conditional_t <
is_deleter_function_candidate_v<D>,
deleter_pointer_wrapper<T>,
D
>;


using deleter_type = std::conditional_t <is_deleter_function_candidate_v<D>, deleter_pointer_wrapper<T>, D>;: This line defines a type alias named deleter_type. It essentially duplicates the conditional
type selection from the class inheritance, making the deleter type more convenient to refer to within the class. It's the same logic as before: it determines whether the internal deleter will be 
deleter_pointer_wrapper<T> or D itself depending on if D is a function pointer.

T* p = nullptr;
T* p = nullptr;: This line declares a private member variable p of type T*. This pointer will store the address of the managed object.
It's initialized to nullptr to indicate it doesn't point to anything initially.

public:
    unique_ptr() = default;

public:: This keyword marks the beginning of the public section of the class, where members are accessible from outside the class.
unique_ptr() = default;: This line defines the default constructor. = default tells the compiler to generate the default constructor automatically.
This default constructor will initialize the p pointer to nullptr.

unique_ptr(T* p) : p{ p } {
    }

unique_ptr(T* p) : p{ p } {}: This is the constructor that takes a raw pointer p as an argument.
: p{ p }: This is a member initializer list. It initializes the p member variable of the unique_ptr object with the value of the input pointer p. This means the unique_ptr now owns the memory pointed to by p.
{}: This is the constructor body, which is empty in this case. The initialization is handled entirely in the member initializer list.
This constructor takes ownership of the raw pointer p.


unique_ptr(T* p, void (*pf)(T*))
    : deleter_type{ pf }, p{ p } {
    }


unique_ptr(T* p, void (*pf)(T*)): This is a constructor that takes a raw pointer p and a function pointer pf as arguments.
void (*pf)(T*): This declares pf as a pointer to a function that takes a T* (a pointer to an object of type T) as input and returns void (nothing). 
This function will be used as the custom deleter.
: deleter_type{ pf }, p{ p }: This is the member initializer list.
deleter_type{ pf }: This initializes the deleter_type member (which, as we saw earlier, will likely be a deleter_pointer_wrapper<T> if 
pf is a function pointer, or D directly if not) with the function pointer pf. The wrapper class will handle storing and calling the function pointer.
p{ p }: This initializes the p member variable with the input pointer p.
{}: The constructor body is empty.


~unique_ptr() {
        (*static_cast<deleter_type*>(this))(p);
    }
};

~unique_ptr() { ... }: This is the destructor of the unique_ptr class. It's called automatically when a unique_ptr object goes out of scope.
(*static_cast<deleter_type*>(this))(p);: This is the core of the destructor's functionality â€“ it calls the deleter to free the managed memory.
static_cast<deleter_type*>(this): This performs a static cast. Remember that unique_ptr inherits from either D or deleter_pointer_wrapper<T>. 
This cast treats the unique_ptr object as its base class (which is the deleter type). This is how the destructor accesses the deleter object or 
function pointer through the base class pointer.
(* ... )(p): This dereferences the casted pointer (treating it as a function pointer or a functor object) and calls it with the raw pointer p as the argument. 
This invokes the deleter, which then frees the memory pointed to by p.

In Summary:

This code implements a basic unique_ptr class that manages the lifetime of a dynamically allocated object.  It ensures that the memory is automatically freed 
when the unique_ptr goes out of scope, preventing memory leaks.  The use of templates and conditional inheritance allows it to work with different types of objects
and different deletion strategies (default delete, custom function pointers, or custom functors).

Important Note: This is a simplified implementation. A full std::unique_ptr has additional features like move semantics, reset capabilities, and other refinements for robustness and efficiency.
