The function f(const char *name) is designed to read data from a file, store it in a vector, and then process the data. Let's go through it step-by-step:

File Opening:

FILE *file = open_file(name); This line attempts to open the file specified by the name (a C-style string) using a function open_file. We can assume open_file is a custom function to handle file opening, possibly including error checking.
if(!file) return; // failure If open_file fails to open the file (returns a null pointer), the function immediately returns, effectively handling the file opening failure.
Vector Initialization:

vector<char> v; A std::vector named v is created. This vector will store the characters read from the file.
Buffer Declaration:

char buf[N]; A character array buf of size N is declared. N is assumed to be a positive integral constant, meaning it's a constant integer value defined elsewhere in the code (e.g., #define N 1024). 
This buffer will be used to read chunks of data from the file.
try-catch Block:
This block encloses the core file reading and processing logic to handle potential exceptions gracefully.

Reading Loop:

for(int n = read_from(file, buf, N); n != 0; n = read_from(file, buf, N)) This loop reads data from the file in chunks of up to N characters at a time.
int n = read_from(file, buf, N); read_from is another custom function (similar to fread in C) that reads up to N characters from the file and stores them in the buf array. It returns the number of characters actually read (n). 
If read_from encounters an error or reaches the end of the file, it will likely return 0.
n != 0; The loop continues as long as read_from successfully read at least one character (n is not 0).
n = read_from(file, buf, N); The loop updates n with the number of characters read in each iteration.
v.insert(end(v), buf + 0, buf + n); This line appends the characters read to the v vector. It inserts the characters from buf + 0 (the beginning of the buffer) up to buf + n (the n-th character) into the vector. 
This effectively adds n characters to the end of the vector.
Processing:

process(v); Once all the data has been read into the vector, this line calls a function process (presumably defined elsewhere) to perform some operations on the data stored in the v vector.
File Closing (Successful Path):

close_file(file); If the reading and processing are successful, this line closes the file using the close_file function.
Exception Handling (catch(...)):

catch(...) { ... } This catch block is designed to catch any exception that might be thrown within the try block. The ... is a catch-all handler.
close_file(file); Even if an exception occurs during reading or processing, the close_file function is called to ensure the file is closed properly. This is crucial to avoid resource leaks.
throw; This line re-throws the exception that was caught. Re-throwing means the exception is passed up to the calling function to handle. This allows the caller to be aware that an error occurred, 
even though the function f has cleaned up the file resource.
Key Points and Improvements

Error Handling: The code handles file opening failures but relies on exceptions for other errors (e.g., read_from failing, process throwing errors).
Resource Management: The use of try-catch and close_file guarantees that the file is closed even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks. This is important for robust code.
Custom Functions: The code relies on custom functions (open_file, read_from, close_file, process), so the exact behavior depends on their implementations.
noexcept Consideration: Given that the catch block re-throws the exception, the function f cannot be marked noexcept. If the intention is to have a noexcept function,
the internal exception handling might need to be different (e.g., logging the error and returning a failure status instead of re-throwing).
