1. RAII example- FileCloser

class FileCloser { // perfectible, as we will see
FILE * file;
public:
FileCloser(FILE *file) : file{ file } {
}
~FileCloser() {
close_file(file);
}
};
void f(const char *name) {
FILE *file = open_file(name);
if(!file) return; // failure
FileCloser fc{ file }; // <-- fc manages file now
vector<char> v;
char buf[N]; // N is a positive integral constant
for(int n = read_from(file, buf, N); n != 0;
n = read_from(file, buf, N))
v.insert(end(v), buf + 0, buf + n);
process(v); // our processing function
} // implicit close_file(file)

=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
void f(const char *name) {
FILE *file = open_file(name);
if(!file) return; // failure
vector<char> v;
char buf[N]; // N is a positive integral constant
try {
for(int n = read_from(file, buf, N); n != 0;
n = read_from(file, buf, N))
v.insert(end(v), buf + 0, buf + n);
process(v); // our processing function
close_file(file);
} catch(...) { // catch anything
close_file(file);
throw; // re-throw what we caught
}
}

The function f(const char *name) is designed to read data from a file, store it in a vector, and then process the data. Let's go through it step-by-step:

File Opening:

FILE *file = open_file(name); This line attempts to open the file specified by the name (a C-style string) using a function open_file. We can assume open_file is a custom function to handle file opening, possibly including error checking.
if(!file) return; // failure If open_file fails to open the file (returns a null pointer), the function immediately returns, effectively handling the file opening failure.
Vector Initialization:

vector<char> v; A std::vector named v is created. This vector will store the characters read from the file.
Buffer Declaration:

char buf[N]; A character array buf of size N is declared. N is assumed to be a positive integral constant, meaning it's a constant integer value defined elsewhere in the code (e.g., #define N 1024). 
This buffer will be used to read chunks of data from the file.
try-catch Block:
This block encloses the core file reading and processing logic to handle potential exceptions gracefully.

Reading Loop:

for(int n = read_from(file, buf, N); n != 0; n = read_from(file, buf, N)) This loop reads data from the file in chunks of up to N characters at a time.
int n = read_from(file, buf, N); read_from is another custom function (similar to fread in C) that reads up to N characters from the file and stores them in the buf array. It returns the number of characters actually read (n). 
If read_from encounters an error or reaches the end of the file, it will likely return 0.
n != 0; The loop continues as long as read_from successfully read at least one character (n is not 0).
n = read_from(file, buf, N); The loop updates n with the number of characters read in each iteration.
v.insert(end(v), buf + 0, buf + n); This line appends the characters read to the v vector. It inserts the characters from buf + 0 (the beginning of the buffer) up to buf + n (the n-th character) into the vector. 
This effectively adds n characters to the end of the vector.
Processing:

process(v); Once all the data has been read into the vector, this line calls a function process (presumably defined elsewhere) to perform some operations on the data stored in the v vector.
File Closing (Successful Path):

close_file(file); If the reading and processing are successful, this line closes the file using the close_file function.
Exception Handling (catch(...)):

catch(...) { ... } This catch block is designed to catch any exception that might be thrown within the try block. The ... is a catch-all handler.
close_file(file); Even if an exception occurs during reading or processing, the close_file function is called to ensure the file is closed properly. This is crucial to avoid resource leaks.
throw; This line re-throws the exception that was caught. Re-throwing means the exception is passed up to the calling function to handle. This allows the caller to be aware that an error occurred, 
even though the function f has cleaned up the file resource.
Key Points and Improvements

Error Handling: The code handles file opening failures but relies on exceptions for other errors (e.g., read_from failing, process throwing errors).
Resource Management: The use of try-catch and close_file guarantees that the file is closed even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks. This is important for robust code.
Custom Functions: The code relies on custom functions (open_file, read_from, close_file, process), so the exact behavior depends on their implementations.
noexcept Consideration: Given that the catch block re-throws the exception, the function f cannot be marked noexcept. If the intention is to have a noexcept function,
the internal exception handling might need to be different (e.g., logging the error and returning a failure status instead of re-throwing).

2. RAII example- scoped_finalizer


template <class F> class scoped_finalizer { // simplified
F f;
public:
scoped_finalizer(F f) : f{ f } {
}
~scoped_finalizer() {
f();
}
};
void f(const char *name) {
FILE *file = open_file(name);
if(!file) return; // failure
auto sf = scoped_finalizer{ [&file] {
close_file(file);
} }; // <-- sf manages file now
vector<char> v;
char buf[N]; // N is a positive integral constant
for(int n = read_from(file, buf, N); n != 0;
n = read_from(file, buf, N))
v.insert(end(v), buf + 0, buf + n);
process(v); // our processing function
} // implicit close_file(file) through sf's destructor


Core Idea: RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)

This code leverages the RAII principle.  RAII ties the management of a resource (in this case, a file pointer) to the lifetime of an object (the scoped_finalizer). 
When the object goes out of scope, its destructor is automatically called, which releases the resource.  This prevents resource leaks, even in the face of errors.

Let's walk through it step-by-step:

template <class F> class scoped_finalizer { ... }:

This defines a template class called scoped_finalizer. Templates allow you to write generic code that works with different types. In this case, F represents a function object (a callable entity like a function pointer, 
lambda, or a class with an operator()).
F f;: This stores a function object f as a member of the class. This is the function that will be called when the scoped_finalizer object is destroyed. Critically, in this example, f will be a lambda function that closes the file.
scoped_finalizer(F f) : f{ f } { }: This is the constructor. It takes a function object f as input and initializes the member variable f with it.
~scoped_finalizer() { f(); }: This is the destructor. It's automatically called when a scoped_finalizer object goes out of scope (e.g., at the end of the block it was defined in). Inside the destructor, it calls 
the stored function object f().
void f(const char *name) { ... }:

This is the main function that reads from and processes a file. It takes the file's name as input.
FILE *file = open_file(name);: This line attempts to open the file specified by name using a function open_file (presumably defined elsewhere). It returns a file pointer file.
if(!file) return; // failure: If open_file fails (returns a null pointer), the function immediately returns, handling the error gracefully.
auto sf = scoped_finalizer{ [&file] { close_file(file); } };:  This is where the magic happens.

auto sf = scoped_finalizer{ ... };: This creates a scoped_finalizer object named sf. It's initialized directly with a lambda expression.
[&file] { close_file(file); }: This is a lambda expression. It defines an anonymous function that captures the file variable by reference ([&file]). This means the lambda has access to the same file pointer that was opened earlier. 
The lambda's body, close_file(file);, calls a function close_file (presumably defined elsewhere) to close the file.
Crucially, sf now owns the responsibility of closing the file. When sf goes out of scope, its destructor will be called, and the lambda will execute, closing the file.
vector<char> v;:

This declares a vector of char named v. This vector will store the contents of the file.
char buf[N];:

This declares a character array buf of size N (where N is a constant). This array will act as a buffer to read chunks of data from the file.
for(int n = read_from(file, buf, N); n != 0; n = read_from(file, buf, N)) { ... }:

This loop reads data from the file in chunks of up to N bytes at a time.
int n = read_from(file, buf, N);: This calls a function read_from (presumably defined elsewhere) to read up to N bytes from the file pointed to by file into the buffer buf. The function returns the number of bytes actually read (n).
n != 0: The loop continues as long as read_from successfully reads some data (n is not 0). When read_from reaches the end of the file or encounters an error, it will return 0, terminating the loop.
v.insert(end(v), buf + 0, buf + n);:

This line appends the data that was read into the buffer buf to the end of the vector v. buf + 0 points to the beginning of the buffer, and buf + n points to the end of the valid data in the buffer (where n is the number of bytes read).
process(v);:

This calls a function process (presumably defined elsewhere) to perform some operation on the data that was read from the file and stored in the vector v.
// implicit close_file(file) through sf's destructor:

This comment highlights the key benefit of using scoped_finalizer. When the function f returns (either normally or due to an exception), the sf object goes out of scope. 
Its destructor is called, which in turn calls the lambda expression that closes the file. This happens regardless of how the function exits, ensuring the file is always closed.
In summary:

This code provides a very clean and safe way to handle file resources. By using scoped_finalizer and a lambda expression, it guarantees that the file will be closed, even if errors occur during reading or processing. 
This prevents resource leaks and makes the code more reliable.  The RAII principle is a cornerstone of modern C++ programming for robust resource management.
